# Getting Started Overview

Get started with Pantheon by:

* [Installing Pantheon](../Installation/Install-Binaries.md) and [starting a node](Starting-Pantheon.md)
* Running from the [Pantheon Docker image](Run-Docker-Image.md)
* Using the [Private Network Quickstart](../Tutorials/Private-Network-Quickstart.md) 

The fastest way to run a single node and connect to the Ethereum mainnet (or a public testnet) is by using the [Docker image](Run-Docker-Image.md). 

To run a private network on which you can make JSON-RPC requests and send transactions, the [Private Network Quickstart](../Tutorials/Private-Network-Quickstart.md) sets up a network of Pantheon nodes in Docker containers.
